Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your digital garden and notes as a website for free. Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.

I just prefer to work with Markdown than HTML and I'm not a designer but Typescript is cool and React is okay.

A website to showcase myself and my work as well as write some blogs.
