This is going to be some basic notes on FPGAs for me to understand it technically and different purposes of it
(from a learning college student).

Got into FPGAs Fall 2023 with ENEE245  
Classes:
- ENEE245
- ENEE408C
- ENEE459D

Things I'm looking into:
- Design Tools
- Verilog / SystemVerilog
- Integration with languages like C / C++ / Python
- Use in networking and algorithms
