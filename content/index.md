<h1>my name is <span style="color:#ffb7c5">victor liu</span></h1>

Currently, a Computer Engineering student at University of Maryland.  
(ECE / EECS major at other schools)

I'm passionate in <span style="color:#ffb7c5"><b>low-level software engineering</b></span> and <span style="color:#ffb7c5"><b>FPGA engineering</b></span>  
and topics such as <span class="bw"><i>computer architecture</i></span> and <span class="bw"><i>operating systems</i></span>.

here you can find a bit about me, a showcase of my crafts, and a notebook on a few of my thoughts.

# working on

[[fpga/index|FPGA]]: learning about FPGAs specifically how to connect them to software and accelerating computing and its applications such as accelerating AI, high performance computing, and trading.

[[c-to-verilog|C to Verilog]]: Similar to High-Level Synthesis and Hardcaml, but a much smaller scale. trying to understand the development of these tools mostly

[[music quiz|Music Quiz]]: for fun, a discord bot (NodeJS) that plays songs and the player guesses the song and artist by typing

figuring out how to cook good meals outside of just frozen food üç≥  
mostly cooking japanese food
