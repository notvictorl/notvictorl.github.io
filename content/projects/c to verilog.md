So, I want to build a C to HDL tool or high-level synthesis in general, but designing one proves to be much harder than anticipated.

I was thinking of maybe switching to programming this in OCaml as I am most familiar with designing a compiler in that currently from CMSC330.

My plan is to take C-esque software language to Verilog hardware language  
(likely will not compile in C)

To Start:
1. Lexer - To Tokenize C language
2. Parser - Check Grammar
3. Translator - Instead of Evaluate take the parsed code and convert to Verilog language

OCaml or any functional programming language work similarly to that of an FPGA board which always has an output for every input.

Considering to use both C++ and OCaml each for different purposes.
